* Notice *
**********

This app is in its very early stages of development. Much of its functionality
has yet to be implemented and there are bound to be bugs. If you would like to 
try our app, we recommend that you run it in an AVD (Android virtual device).

* Description *
***************

Task Butler is a task organization app for Android 2.2+. Using Task Butler, you
can create tasks for your everyday life such as paying bills or picking up the
dry-cleaning. Tasks can be customized by importance, due date, category, and
more. Task Butler will notify you when a task is due, and will automatically
repeat tasks that are recurring (such as bills payments). Keep your life
organized and never miss an obligation or deadline again with Task Butler!

Task Butler is being developed as part of CS 499 Summer 2012 at Worcester State
University.
